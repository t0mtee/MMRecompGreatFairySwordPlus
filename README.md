# Majora's Mask: Recompiled Great Fairy's Sword Plus

This is a mod for Zelda64Recompiled that allows the Great Fairy's Sword to be optionally equipped to the Attack button instead of the C-buttons, making it a lot more functionally useful (although you can't use a shield with it, which keeps the game balanced).

If you have it installed, place this mod below [Forms Use More Items](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/Forms_Use_More_Items/) (with this mod, equipping the Great Fairy's Sword to Deku Link is impossible, so it should be greyed out in the item select screen). Furthermore, [EZ Text Replacer API](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/EZ_Text_Replacer_API/) is required.

I don't think there's any possibilities for the sword to unequip itself, but if you find any, please let me know by opening an issue in this repo!
