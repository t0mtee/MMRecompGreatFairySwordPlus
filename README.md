# Majora's Mask: Recompiled Great Fairy's Sword Plus

This is a mod for Zelda64Recompiled that allows the Great Fairy's Sword to be optionally equipped to the B button instead of the C buttons, making it a lot more functionally useful (although you can't use a shield with it, which keeps the game balanced).

I don't think there's any possibilities for the sword to unequip itself, but if you find any, please let me know by opening an issue on this repo!
