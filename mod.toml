This is a mod for Zelda64Recompiled that allows the Great Fairy's Sword to be optionally equipped to the Attack button instead of the C-buttons, making it a lot more functionally useful (although you can't use a shield with it, which keeps the game balanced).

If you have it installed, place this mod below Forms Use More Items (with this mod, equipping the Great Fairy's Sword to Deku Link is impossible, so it should be greyed out in the item select screen). Furthermore, EZ Text Replacer API is required.
